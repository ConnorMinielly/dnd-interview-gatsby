# Message to The Players

It's that time of year again. The time of year where you start to see unfamiliar faces the Cafetorezium (the Curator thought it needed a more magical name that "the mess hall"). You recall, over two years ago now, when you received your letter of Acquisition from the museum which officially signaled your entrance into the hiring process. It wasn't the end of course, there was the other interviews, the internship, the Performance Review, and many other trials along the way. Nevertheless that you remember that letter as the beginning of your journey, your responses on that magical document determining your fate for every day since and every day to come. The words of the Curator echo in your mind "History lies behind and before you in equal measure, remembering what happened will help you on your way to happening well in the future!". What did your write on that page anyway you wonder, how did you get here...?

DM's Note: Let me know when you've submitted this as i didn't build in and email notification cause... i didn't wanna. Answer as much or as little as you like. The only required fields are the first three (name, class, race/description). If you have any issues message me, I recommend writing your answers in a different spot that you can save to ensure you don't loose them to my shoddy programming.
